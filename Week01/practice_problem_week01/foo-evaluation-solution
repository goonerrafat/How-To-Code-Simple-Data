; first defining the function

(define (foo s)
  (if (string=? (substring s 0 1) "a")
      (string-append s "a")
      s))

;now calling the function
(foo (substring "abcde" 0 3))

; in this above line at first substring is evaluated and the string
; then turn to "abc". so
(foo "abc")
;then as usual the function call is replaced by function body

(if (string=? (substring "abc" 0 1) "a")
    (string-append "abc" "a")
    "abc")

; now here at first by following inside-outside rule substring is evaluated
; so it turns into
(if (string=? "a" "a")
    (string-append "abc" "a")
    "abc")

; now the two "a"'s are compared and it evaluated as true.so
(if true
    (string-append "abc" "a")
    "abc")

;now as it evaluated as true then first expression would be evaluated
;so at first string-append is going to be evaluated.so
(if true
    "abca"
    "abc")
;then the function return "abca"
